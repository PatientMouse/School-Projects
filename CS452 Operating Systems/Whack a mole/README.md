# Project 2: Whack a mole

* Author(s): Andrew Gerber with code from Buff
* Class: CS452
* Semester: Fall 2021

## Overview

    This is the second project in cs452. It is an implementation of our deq, Wrapping said deq into a multithreaded safe queue and applying it in the multi-call function that can be used with the mole and lawn functions.

## Compiling and Using

To compile and run this program, from the directory type in terminal:
    $make clean
    $make
    then to run it it depends on the executable name it could be the directory name or wam. It will be the only executable in the folder

    This is will run the main.c file using my files and pre-given files by Buff. This used a top level make file
    given you are in our pub directory. 
	
## Discussion

    This project was not extremely hard but a challenge for sure, I spend a fair amount of time on it and only finished a day before the due date. I did not know what a wrapper class was entirety and had to refresh on that. I emailed with the professor quite some to get guidance and I eventually finished the assignment.

## Testing

    I tested this program by hard coding in print statements to test the mtq functionality in isolation then used it in my main along with the new produce and consume functions to produce a whack a mole simulator.
