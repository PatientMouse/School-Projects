# Final website for CS401

Name: ANDREW GERBER
email: andrewgerber@u.boisestate.edu

## How to run this website

The hosted site for this website is https://andrewgerberbsu.github.io 
<br>If this link does not work then you can view the website by using an IDE like Webstorm, opening the folder and previewing the index.html in any of the browsers or in house.

## Bugs

The only bug I noticed in this website is that the padding/margin buffer for the bottem of the discography is not working and the page ends right under the text.

## Features

My website has the following features:
- A song randomizer that when clicking on a button will display the song name, album and album cover of one of aries songs.
- A discography that displays all of the songs from aries.
- A about the artist page
- A about the site page


## Notes

The only part of this final that I had to get third part help on was the google api fonts where i imported fonts I liked and chose one for the site.

I may go back and see if I can impliment a way that plays the song when you randomize a song. If I had all the mp3's it would be easy but I am curious if I could import a spotify plugin that I have seen on other sites.
