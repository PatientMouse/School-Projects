## Overview

 In this assignment, we were tasked with translating a simple bank program in java to Golang

## Trouble
this was a pretty straight forward assignment side the accrue and main functionality. *I 'cannot seem to get the main file to reconise bank methods.

*Edit: I finished the assingment and got the accrue and tostring to compile and run, tostring prints nothing.

## Compiling and Using

gccgo -g -c customer.go
gccgo -g -c account.go checking.go saving.go
