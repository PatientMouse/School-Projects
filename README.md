# School Projects

Repository to hold *some* of my coding projects from undergrad. I did not include all of my school projects based on personal decisions, peer privacy, and to highlight my later work.

Projects are in the classes folder with the following languages:

**CS321:** Java

**CS354:** AWK, Go, Scheme, SmallTalk

**CS401:** HTML, CSS

**CS452:** C
